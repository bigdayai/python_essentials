# Python Essentials

Everything you need to know to get started with Python before specializing.
Behind each link is a basic lesson with a list of resources and documentation for learning more.

I recommend using these lessons as a complimentary resource and reference in combination with other free (or low-cost) resources that give you credit for your learning in the form of public XP or certificates.  Read the resources section below to learn more.

### Introduction to Programming
If you're new to programming, I recommend you watch at least the first 10 minutes of this video: [Hal Abelson's Introduction to Computer Science class at MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA). It's a throw back to the 1980's.  Think "Stranger Things" meets Comp Sci. It will give you a great intuition for what programming is all about.

 # Python Resources
 
There are many effective and free (or low-cost) resources for learning Python.  The list below provides an excellent learning progression to ease your way into Python and prioritizes resources where you can get credit for your learning in the form of a certificate.  "Certs" are respected in the field and you can easily display them on your professional profiles to show what you know.

 ## Datacamp
 
Datacamp starts free and then you can sign up for a low-cost annual subscription.  The lessons are simple and straightforward, you get XP for every lesson completed, and you get a certificate for every course you complete.  They also provide learning tracks for different jobs and skill specializations.  ***I highly recommend completing one of these tracks before you invest in a bootcamp or a degree program.***  Datacamp is a low-risk introduction that will set you up for success if you do complete a bigger program and it also gives you a chance to see if a specialization is a good fit.

 2. [Datacamp Intermediate Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-python)

 ## W3 Schools, Programiz, & GeeksforGeeks
 
 These three sites provide a simple, well organized and straightforward learning path to Python.  They also offer certs to prove your mastery, although they may not be as well respected as Datacamp, Codecademy or Coursera which are all more expensive.  These sites are also great references that you can come back to again and again.

 ## Debugging & Troubleshooting with Stack Overflow & Google
 
 When you run into problems with your code that you just don't understand and the resources above aren't getting you the answers you need, then Stack Overflow has your back.  Most likely, in the history of programming, someone has encountered the same issue and the coding community helps each other out by posting solutions on Stack Overflow.  Just do a Google search with the question you want answered and a Stack Overflow Q&A page will most likely be at the top of the results.
 * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

## Python Documentation

And the last resource I'll share is the Python documentation.  The people who build Python also write a user manual that goes into all the details of the language.  I say build in the present tense because the language is being continually updated, so the Python Documentation is the best source of Truth on how the latest version of Python works.  Documentation tends to be more dense and/or esoteric than the resources listed above, but it's always good to have in your backpocket when you're in a bind.
