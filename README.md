# Python Essentials

Everything you need to know to get started with Python before specializing.
Behind each link is a basic lesson with a list of resources and documentation for learning more.

I recommend using these lessons as a complimentary resource and reference in combination with other free (or low-cost) resources that give you credit for your learning in the form of public XP or certificates.  Read the resources section below to learn more.

### Introduction to Programming
If you're new to programming, I recommend you watch this video of [Hal Abelson's Introduction to Computer Science class at MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA). It's a relic containing concepts that are as true today as they were in 2005.

 # Python Resources
 
There are many effective and free (or low-cost) resources for learning Python.  The list below provides an excellent learning progression to ease your way into Python and prioritizes resources where you can get credit for your learning in the form of a certificate.  "Certs" are respected in the field and you can easily display them on your professional profiles to show what you know.
 
 ## Datacamp
 
Datacamp starts free and then you can sign up for a low-cost annual subscription.  The lessons are simple and straightforward, you get XP for every lesson completed, and you get a certificate for every course you complete.  They also provide learning tracks for different jobs and skill specializations.  ***I highly recommend completing one of these tracks before you invest in a bootcamp or a degree program.***  Datacamp is a low-risk introduction that will set you up for success if you do complete a bigger program and it also gives you a chance to see if a specialization is a good fit.
