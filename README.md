# Python Essentials
 Everything you need to know to get started with Python.
 
 This repo provides a general overview of all the concepts displayed in my term sheet below.
 
 As a coder, my intention is not to reinvent the wheel, but to provide a clear and currated roadmap of what and how to learn.
 
 # Python Resources
 
 There are many amazing and free or low-cost resources for learning Python and I will reference many of them throughout my lessons.
 The list below provides an excellent learning progression to ease your way into Python and prioritizes resources where you can get credit for your learning in the form of a certificate.  Certs are great, and respected in the field, for demonstrating your learning and you can easily display them on your professional profiles.
 
 ## Datacamp
 
 Datacamp starts free and then you can sign up for a low-cost annual subscription.  The lessons are simple and straightforward, you get XP for every lesson completed, and you get a certificate for every course you complete.  They also provide learning tracks for different jobs and applications.  ***I highly recommend completing one of these tracks before you choose a bootcamp or higher degree in these areas.  It's a great, low-cost introduction that will set you up for success and also gives you a chance to see if it's really what you want to specialize in.***
